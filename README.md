# maze-solvers
## An evolutionary computation approach to solving mazes represented by adjacency matrices
Maze Solver Evolution.py runs an EC to evolve candidate solutions for a generated set of mazes. Solvers can either be 'memory based' which operate on a given maze to find the optimal route from start to end node, or 'smart' which operate on a randomly generated maze to develop a general strategy to find optimal routes.
