# maze-solvers
## An evolutionary computation approach to solving mazes represented by adjacency matrices
Maze Solver Evolution.py runs an EC to evolve candidate solutions for a generated set of mazes. Solvers can either be 'memory based' which operate on a given maze to find the optimal route from start to end node, or 'smart' which operate on a set of randomly generated mazes to develop a general strategy to find optimal routes.
Maze Solver Step Through.xlsx presents a workbook which allows tracking the evaluation process of a single layer of a smart solver in the same fashion as the evaluate_smart_solver function. This was used to develop the structure of a 'no-revisit' solution, a simple depth first search solution that prioritizes nodes with higher degree, and a hybrid 'optimal' solution. These solvers have default constructor functions for performance comparison with randomly evolved solutions (as per evaluate_mazes function).
